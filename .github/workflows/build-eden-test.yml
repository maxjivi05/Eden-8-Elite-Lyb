# GitHub Actions Workflow: Build Eden for Android (Lybxlpsv Version)
#
# This workflow is designed to be highly accurate and robust. It performs the following steps:
# 1. Checks out the current repository to gain access to patch files.
# 2. Installs all necessary build dependencies on an Ubuntu runner.
# 3. Clones the latest official Eden source code into a dedicated directory.
# 4. Atomically applies the provided multi-part patch file and the Android-specific Vulkan loader fix.
#    - Using 'git apply' ensures patches are applied correctly or the build fails safely.
# 5. Leverages ccache for accelerated compilation on subsequent runs.
# 6. Executes the Android build script.
# 7. Uploads the final compiled APK as a build artifact.
